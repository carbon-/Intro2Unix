Back to High School
=====================

Problem 1 (20 points)
----------------------  

Write a script in Python called <b>quad</b> that solves a user inputted quadratic equation. The user inputs the equation in its standard form: ax^2+bx+c and the program should calculate and print its roots. The output should be formatted to two decimal places. The program should also track how many equations it successfully solved.

Error checking needs to be done to make sure the equation is in standard form. If no roots exist print NaN for both roots. This equation should not be counted towards successfully processed equations.

Example
--------  
	% ./quad.py x^2+6x+8
	% The roots are equation 1: R1 = 2, R2 = 4
	% Total equations processed: 1



Problem 2 (20 points)
----------------------
Modify the first problem to accept multiple arguments. Rename the file quad2.py  

	% .quad.py x^2+6x+8 x^2+7x+12
	% The roots for equation 1: R1 = 2, R2 = 4
	% The roots for equation 2: R1 = 3, R2 = 4
	% Total equations processed: 2

quad.py and quad2.py should be submitted to Scholar by the due date.
