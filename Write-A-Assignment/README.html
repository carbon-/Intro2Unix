<li><p>The assignment is modeled after Homework 3 where the students where had experience with Python from previous exercises. The exercise is meant to be a bit more advanced than Homework 2 and teach some advance topics about stripping and splitting the command line arguments and handling specific error messages. The exercise also teaches how to handle multiple command arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>The assignment has two problems. Each problem is worth 20 points. Syntax, style and content should be worth 10 points. While functionality should be worth the remaining 10. If the solution fails to work the student should be given a zero.</p></li>
